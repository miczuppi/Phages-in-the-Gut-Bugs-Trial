# Phages-in-the-Gut-Bugs-Trial

In this repository, we provide the custom codes used to characterize the gut phageome of the participants in the Gut Bugs Trial, as outlined in the manuscript Fecal Microbiota Transplantation alters gut phage communities in a clinical trial for obesity. 

Clustering of UViGs into vOTUs

The UViGs were clustered into vOTUs according to MIUViG standards, _i.e._ 95% ANI over 85% AF of the shortest contig [(Roux et al, 2019)]([url](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4306)). UViGs were compared with FastANI (_v_1.3.3)
